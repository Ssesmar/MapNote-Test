# MapNote
## [2.0.4](https://github.com/Ssesmar/MapNote) (2024-06-17)
- Note:

-- MapNotes now works on every version of World of Warcraft. Classic Era / Cataclysm and Retail

Version: 2.0.4

PTR:
The positions on the continent map of Khaz Algar have been corrected
changed the color from Path nodes from yellow to green for better visibility

Retail:
added Path icons to all zones maps and minimap in the Zone / Minimap tab
added a new function for multi transport icons in a zone or capitals (e.g. portals, paths) with 2 to a maximum of 3 locations
    Clicking left, right or middle mouse button now opens the corresponding map
    These icons show which button opens which card
    This function of these icons only works without holding down the Shift key
    regardless of whether the MapNotes Shift function is activated or not
    because the Shift + Right mouse button would now set a TomTom point and would not open the second displayed zone map

changed the worldmapbutton function on Continents
    rightclick on a Continent, did not longer hide all icons on EVERY continent, now its only hidding the icons on the actual opend continent at the Worldmap
changed the TomTom function. Now u have to press Shift + Rightclick to set a TomTom waypoint
    regardless of whether the MapNotes Shift function is activated or not


2.0.3
added a new function for delete icons
    Now it is possible to delete this specific icon with ALT + left click on an icon so that it is no longer displayed on this map type.
    These deleted icons are saved individually for each character.
    In the MapNotes menu in the gernal tab, these deleted icons can be shown again using the corresponding button (Zones/Continent/Azeroth/Dungeon/Capitals)
    If you delete a symbol in a capital, it will also be deleted on the capital minimap. The same applies to the zone map and the minimap
added Mailboxes in Capitals
changed the Iconsytle from Paths

    Displays instance entrances, portals, ships, zeppelins, exits, passage, enemy faction and other transport icons
    All icons can be activated or deactivated separately and all icons can also be hidden or shown with a single click. Called  "Hide MapNotes!"
    You can use the MapNotes symbols with or without shift-clicking. Called "Shift function"
    Display special MapNotes icons for Horde and Alliance that display additional information on all maps. Called "MapNotes VS. blizzard"
    Display icons of the other faction that can be activated by the other faction. Called "Enemey Faction"
    All symbols are clickable (except on the minimap) and have a function
    Normally, on a maximized map, you cannot use instance icons from Blizzard or other addons that would open the adventure guide.
    But not for MapNotes u can use all functions on minimized or maximized maps!

Map function with or without Shift. Simply select the “Shift Function” in the MapNotes menu on or off:

    Shift+Right-click or Right-click adds a TomTom waypoint (except on the Azeroth map)
    Shift+Left-click or Left-click on a Instance icon opens the corresponding dungeon in the adventure guide (only works if the map is NOT maximized)
    Shift+Left-click or Left-click on a Portal, Exit, Passage, Ship, Zeppelin, Transport or Old Instance icon displays the associated map
    For example: When you hover over a portal icon, the name of where that portal would go will appear. For example => Orgrimmar. If you click on this symbol, the map of Orgrimmar will open (Regardless of whether the map is reduced in size or in full screen, both work)
