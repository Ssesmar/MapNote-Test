# MapNote
## [1.9.5](https://github.com/Ssesmar/MapNote) (2024-05-28)
- Note:

-- MapNotes now works on every version of World of Warcraft. Classic Era / Cataclysm and Retail

Retail:
    • Each character has their own Mapnotes profile
    • add new Tabs called Capitals and Capital - Minimap
    • The Zones tab is no longer responsible for Zone icons  that were within “Capitals”, but rather the new “Capitals” tab
    • The Minimap tab is no longer responsible for Minimap icons that were within “Capitals”, but rather the new “Capitals - Minimap” tab
    • There are 5 submenus in the new tab Capital and Capital - Minimap
    • Submenu 1 Capitals: Here you can switch off/show all icons within a specific capital
    • Submenu 2 Instance icons: Here you can switch off/show various instance icons. This option applies to all cities assigned to the Capital category
    • Submenu 3 Transport icons: Here you can switch off/show various Transport icons. This option applies to all cities assigned to the Capital category
    • Submenu 4 Profession icons: Here you can switch off/show various Profession icons. This option applies to all cities assigned to the Capital category
    • Submenu 5 General icons: Here you can switch off/show various General icons. This option applies to all cities assigned to the Capital category
    • Likewise, right-clicking on the MapNotes world map symbol within a capital now has its own function as outside a capital in a zone.
    • Within a capital city, right-clicking on the MapNotes map button hides all zone symbols for all capital cities. 
    • The zone symbols outside of a capital city remain unaffected and can be hidden by right-clicking on them on a zone map

Cataclysm:

    • some flightpoints changes

Classic Era & Hardcore:

    • some flightpoints and spirit healer changes

REQUIRES --> HandyNotes <-- to be installed                                                                                    

    A collection of various icons on various maps from previous expansions up to Dragonflight. Displays raid and dungeon entrances, portals, ships, zeppelins, exits and passage icons
    Displays Horde and Alliance icons that can also be activated by the other faction
    All symbols are clickable (except on the minimap) and have a function

Information:

    Displays instance entrances, portals, ships, zeppelins, exits, passage, enemy faction and other transport icons
    All icons can be activated or deactivated separately and all icons can also be hidden or shown with a single click. Called  "Hide MapNotes!"
    You can use the MapNotes symbols with or without shift-clicking. Called "Shift function"
    Display special MapNotes icons for Horde and Alliance that display additional information on all maps. Called "MapNotes VS. blizzard"
    Display icons of the other faction that can be activated by the other faction. Called "Enemey Faction"
    All symbols are clickable (except on the minimap) and have a function
    Normally, on a maximized map, you cannot use instance icons from Blizzard or other addons that would open the adventure guide.
    But not for MapNotes u can use all functions on minimized or maximized maps!

Map function with or without Shift. Simply select the “Shift Function” in the MapNotes menu on or off:

    Shift+Right-click or Right-click adds a TomTom waypoint (except on the Azeroth map)
    Shift+Left-click or Left-click on a Instance icon opens the corresponding dungeon in the adventure guide (only works if the map is NOT maximized)
    Shift+Left-click or Left-click on a Portal, Exit, Passage, Ship, Zeppelin, Transport or Old Instance icon displays the associated map
    For example: When you hover over a portal icon, the name of where that portal would go will appear. For example => Orgrimmar. If you click on this symbol, the map of Orgrimmar will open (Regardless of whether the map is reduced in size or in full screen, both work)

WorldmapButton:

    Left-click opens or close the MapNote setting menu
    Right-click shows or hides all activated MapNotes icons of the current map type that is currently open (World Map/Azeroth/Continent/Zone/Dungeon)
